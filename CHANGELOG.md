## 2.4.0 (release date 28.12.2019)

Identical to `2.0.0-rc.2`, changes since previous stable version (`2.3.0`) are listed.

This release introduces `IStatefulVideo` and tis Abstract and HTML5 implementations. Stateful Video has a much stricter model that leverages more stability, standardisation and error handling. Additionally it supports DRM playback.
Stateful Video is meant to replace current IVideo, but at this point both are available and the latte is not even deprecated.
Migrating to Stateful Video will require a large effort as its model and APIs are vastly incompatible with previous IVideo.

For more details on Stateful Video see [docs/video](./docs/video/).

Other changes:

* `PrincipalAxisNavigation` is now used as first spatial navigation strategy of choice
* `EventPublisher` refactored, added `runAfterCurrentEvent` method, improved test coverage
* QHD resolution support removed, 4K and 8K added
* `Info.osdResolutionType` deprecated in favor of `getOSDResolution` and `getPanelResolution`
* `Viewport.getFullScreen` deprecated in favor of `isFullScreen`
* `AbstractStatefulVideo` and `AbstracViewport` constructors both now accept panel and app resolutions
* `zb/http` `decodeParams` now returns properly empty object if query string is empty as opposed to object with empty keys

## 2.4.0-rc.2 (release date 28.12.2019)

### Framework
* Ensure no changes in html5 engine or Video happen once Video entered `ERROR` state
* `EVENT_ERROR` now tries to make a better message 

### Tools
* Fixed issue when errors occurred while loading custom configs could be consumed and not reported 

## 2.4.0-rc.1 (release date 27.12.2019)

### Framework
* Aborting transition in `StateMachine` now restores it to previous state

### Tools
* ESLint, its configs and plugins updated
* Fix polyfills not being included in build
* Workaround for GCC issue that prevents object destructuring from working without native `Object.assign` 

## 2.4.0-alpha.6 (release date 19.12.2019)

### Framework
* `PrincipalAxisNavigation` is now used as first spatial navigation strategy of choice
* Improved stability of `StatefulVideo`, especially when destroying it
* `EVENT_STATE_EXIT` now happens before asynchronous transitions. This makes `getState` return `null` in between states. `getPendingTransitions` should be used in this occasions.
* `EventPublisher` refactored, added `runAfterCurrentEvent` method, improved test coverage

## 2.4.0-alpha.5 (release date 16.12.2019)
### Framework
* Ensure `getUrl` always returns url in LOADING state

* new `IStatefulVideo` methods: static `isDRMSupported`, static `canHandleMultiDRM`, `attachDRM`, `detachDRM`.
* new interfaces and classes: `IDRMClient`, `AbstractDRMClient`, `PlayReadyClient`.
* `PrepareOption.FORMAT` was renamed to `PrepareOption.TYPE` and now accepts mime-type. `MediaType` enum added with common mime types.

## 2.4.0-alpha.1 (release date 19.11.2019)

Unstable channel release.

### Framework
* `IStatefulVideo`, `AbstractStatefulVideo` and `StatefulHtml5Video` classes and `Device.createStatefulVideo` were added. This a new video interface expected to eventually replace `IVideo`, in foreseeable future however they will coexist. It's much more strict and standardized. See [](./docs/video)

* Fixed GCC warnings in StateMachine.

## 2.2.3 (release date: 24.09.2019)

### Tools
* `postcss.extraPlugins` property was split into two: `filePlugins` and `bundlePlugins` to allow more granular control over when plugins are run. `filePlugins` is similar to `extraPlugins` behaviour prior to version 2.2.0.

## 2.2.2 (release date: 20.09.2019)

### Framework
* Avoid using `ParentNode.prepend` because of some unidentified problems with its polyfill.

### Tools
* Google Closure Compiler updated to 20190909

## 2.2.0 (release date: 27.08.2019)

### Tools
Several changes in CSS processing, some of them might be breaking (see [Migration doc](./docs/migrations/2.2.0.md)):

* New config option `postcss.importEntryPoints`. Setting it will change the behavior of css files processing: Instead of bundling all css files, ZombieBox will look into files set as entry points and will only bundle css imported from them (and descendants).
* `StylesCache` and `Applicatione.getStylesCache` were removed. Instead, dev server now handles its cache.
* As as result, dev server performance was noticeably improved.
* Dev server no longer runs `postcss.extraPlugins` against project css files.
* Build process now processes CSS files after bundling. This significantly improved CSSO effectiveness.

### Framework
* `Container.setTheme` and `Container.getTheme` were deprecated

## 2.1.3 (release date: 15.08.2019)

### Tools

* Updated Closure Compiler to 20190729.0.0

## 2.1.0 (release date: 23.07.2019)

### Framework:

* Added `StateMachine` class.
* `.zb-video-container` element was removed from base framework. This resulted in following API changes:
    * `Application.getVideoContainer()` public method and `_videoContainer` protected property were deprecated
    * `AbstractDevice` no longer takes `HTMLElement` in its constructors
    * `IDevice` and `AbstractDevice` now expect a `Rect` argument in `createVideo`
    * `AbstractVideo` now requires a `Rect` argument in constructor
    
    All methods have fallbacks for backward compatibility and should work if used with old code, but produce compile-time warnings and console errors.
    See [Migration doc](./docs/migrations/2.1.0.md) for more details.  
* `Application.getBody` method was added.

## 2.0.2 (release date: 18.06.2019)
