/**
 * According to spec, browsers may impose limitations to calls for pushState:
 * https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/history.html#history-notes
 * Additionally it's been observed that rapidly triggering history back causes state both in popstate and history.state
 * to become null. This is deduced to be a limitation on browser's part as well.
 * This is impossible to work around on ZombieBox level.
 * Therefore platforms relying on History API and BackButtonListener should be ready for these limitations.
 * Common case that causes problems are rapid keypress events emitted while back button is being held.
 * webOS does not trigger those for Back key, likely to avoid this problem.
 * Android platform was implemented to ignore key repeats as well.
