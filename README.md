# ZombieBox

ZombieBox is a JavaScript framework for development of Smart TV and STB applications.

## Why ZombieBox?

* It's cross-platform;
* It leverages a strongly typed JavaScript by [Google Closure Compiler](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/) and modern ECMAScript;
* It provides a set of typical solutions for TV, such as spatial navigation or remote logging;
* It produces a fast application that has a small size and a minimum of 3rd party code;

## Getting started

Init a node.js project:

```bash
npm init
```

Install ZombieBox and some of its components that you will most likely need:

```bash
npm install zombiebox
npm install zombiebox-platform-pc zombiebox-extension-cutejs
```

Either create application `config.js` manually and start developing or start with a boilerplate:

```bash
npx zombiebox init $NAME

# or without npx:
./node_modules/zombiebox/bin/cli.js init
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npx zombiebox run
```

## Platforms

ZombieBox supports a lot of modern Smart TV and STB platforms and also some legacy but high-demand platforms, which allows you to deliver your application to a wide number of devices.
Any capable platform can be easily support by extending it.

Platforms are a subtype of ZombieBox Addon. See [addons](docs/addons.md) for more information.

Installation of a new platform is easy and nothing more than installation of a new npm package with further saving in the dependencies.

For example, for LG Netcast platform:

```bash
npm i zombiebox-platform-lg --save
```

Then configure the installed platform for building of a distribution package:

```javascript
// Your config.js

module.exports = () => ({
	platforms: {
		lg: {
			// Some platform-specific configuration, see platform documentation
		}
	}
});
```

Finally, build a package:

```bash
npx zombiebox build lg
```

## Extensions:

Extension is a special npm package that extends default functionality of the framework.
To add an extension just install a package via npm and save it in the dependencies.

Extensions are a subtype of ZombieBox Addon. See [addons](docs/addons.md) for more information.

## Configuration

Configuration file is a module that exports a function returning configuration object.

By default, the framework will try to find file `config.js` in the root of the project, but you can set a custom path passing `--config` to the CLI commands.

See [configuration](docs/configuration.md) for details. 

## CLI commands

Use npx to access ZombieBox CLI utility: `npx zombiebox` or `npx zb`.

* `npx zb init <name> [root]` - generates skeleton of a project interactively
* `npx zb run` - starts the development server
* `npx zb build <platforms..>` - builds a distribution package
* `npx zb buildCode` - generates runtime code
* `npx zb (addScene|addPopup|addWidget) <name> [path]` - generates boilerplate code for UI components
* `npx zb generateAliases [filename]` - generates alias map for development tools
* `npx zb <platform> <command>` - runs a specific command provided by a specific platform

## Change log

See the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## Version policy

ZombieBox is not semver compatible. We tried, but this wasn't working well. ZombieBox tries it's best to follow a version policy close to semver that makes sense.

* Major versions denote major changes in code structure and APIs. It's probably either a brand new framework or requires extensive migration if major version changed.
* Minor versions mean new features. There might be **breaking changes in minor versions**, but they likely require minor migrations like changing methods order, signatures or replacing one component with another equivalent. These should be documented in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) and [migratiosn](./docs/migrations) docs.
* Patch versions do not introduce breaking changes and either fix bugs or add neglectable improvements in non-breaking way.
* Pre-release versions are meant to contain experimental features that are going to be introduced later and are likely to break compatibility and be generally unstable. These are only pushed to `@dev` dist-tag.

All ZombieBox components declare their dependencies on each other with `peerDependencies` field in package.json. Node itself does not enforce this field, but ZombieBox does in its CLI commands.
